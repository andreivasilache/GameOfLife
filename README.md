# GameOfLife #

This Web App is made after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">"Game of life"</a>  rules : <br>

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation. <br>
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation. <br>
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation. <br>
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction <br>

Short explanation of code: We are itterating every cell, and we are checking his active neighbors, if we have a specific number of active 
neighbors , we are changing the status of cell,by the above rules.

In development I used: Html, Css, JavaScript, Bootstrap. <br>
